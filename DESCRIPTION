Title: Gene-level RNA-seq differential expression and pathway analysis using Rsubread and the edgeR quasi-likelihood pipeline

Description: This workflow package provides, through its vignette, a complete
    case study analysis of an RNA-Seq experiment using the Rsubread and edgeR
    packages. The workflow starts from read alignment and continues on to data
    exploration, to differential expression and, finally, to pathway analysis.
    The analysis includes publication quality plots, GO and KEGG analyses, and
    the analysis of a expression signature as generated by a prior experiment.
